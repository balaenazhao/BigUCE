**Code used in the study _Building large-scale phylogenies using independent datasets: a draft Avian Tree of Life_**

## **Visualization**
This folder contains the R scripts and associated data that were used to plot the figures in main text and supplementary information.
The pdf outputs from R were later modified using Inkscape, a free vector graphics editor (https://inkscape.org/).

## **Assess Monophyly**
We evaluated clade monophyly for pre-defined clades (e.g., superordinal clades, orders, families and genera) using the R package **MonoPhy**. Tutorial of MonoPhy can be found at https://rdrr.io/cran/MonoPhy/man/AssessMonophyly.html

## **Calculate Tree Distances**
We used the ete3 toolkit to calculate pairwise normalized Robinson Foulds distances. Tutorial can be found at http://etetoolkit.org/documentation/ete-compare/
